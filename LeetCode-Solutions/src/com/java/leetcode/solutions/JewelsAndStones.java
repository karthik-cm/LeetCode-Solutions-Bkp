	You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. 
	Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

	Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

	Example 1:
	Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
	Output: 3
	
	
	Example 2:
	Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
	Output: 0
